## Snackbars

### General notes

The snackbar component is used to display a message up to two lines long.

The dialog component should be used for longer messages or more complex content.

All variants except 'error' will be auto-dismissed in 5 seconds. The time is hard-coded for all snackbars.

The 'error' variant needs to be manually dismissed by the user.

Max snackbars value is set to 10. Old snackbars will be removed from screen to make room for more recent ones.
