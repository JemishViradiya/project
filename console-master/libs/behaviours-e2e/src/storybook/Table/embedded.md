## Embedded tables

### General notes

Use an embedded table when the table needs to displayed as a part of a form or for a nested table.

Embedded tables should not be used as the main table component of a page.

The rows are not selectable and any action is row specific only.

Small icon buttons should be used for all actions in a row.

### Text usage

Column header text should be title case.

Examples _Email Address_, _Created Date_
