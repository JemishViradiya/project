Supported features within the UES console are defined by the "FeatureName" enumeration provided in libs/data/shared/src/featurization/store/types.ts. New features must be added to this enumeration.

Browser local storage feature override settings are supported using the enum string value as the storage key. For example, the following browser local storage setting will enable the presentation of application exceptions for authentication policy within the console, independent of the feature setting within the backend service.
